This site was built as part of <a href="https://twitter.com/historyhackday">@historyhackday</a> 2011 by <a href="https://twitter.com/fredkingham">@fredkingham</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/grahamlyons">@grahamlyons</a>. It was originally built in PHP with the Zend framework and got the user's geolocation data from Twitter. It has since been rebuilt in Python using Flask and using the now more mature geolation api in the browser.
